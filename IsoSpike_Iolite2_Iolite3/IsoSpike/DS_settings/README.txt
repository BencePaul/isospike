This is an template of the DS_settings file for IsoSpike. The file contains four columns of parameters for IsoSpike. Depending on whether an unspiked run is being employed, the UnmixedRatio will either be the value of a standard or the name of a wave containing the unspiked run [NOTE: using an unspiked run requires a further step in the DRS - see documentation]. The mixed ratio contains the names of the waves containing the spiked measurements. The spike ratio is the composition of the double-spike, and the LogMassRatio contains the log of the mass ratios for each isotope pair. FOR A PARTICULAR DOUBLE-SPIKE APPLICATION, MOST OF THESE PARAMETERS ARE SIMPLY SET ONCE AND THEN RE-USED EACH TIME DATA IS PROCESSED. This file can be produced interactively when running IsoSpike.
